# Recipe Finder â€“ JavaScript API Project
This project was built using JavaScript and an external recipe API to dynamically display a curated selection of recipes. I chose to showcase each recipe's name, image, and source link for a clean, user-friendly interface. However, the code is flexible and can be easily extended to include additional data from the JSON response. Feel free to explore and customize it further!
